### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m Alexandre Tupinamba Monaco (Alex Monaco), a graduate from Bournemouth University(UK) at Electronic Engineering, Control and Robotics. I also studied for a full-stack web development, where I learned and still practice everyday PHP, JavaScript, React, Laravel, GraphQL, MySQL, among other stuff. My background in programming started at the University, programming embedded systems using C language.
